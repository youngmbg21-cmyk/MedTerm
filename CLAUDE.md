# CLAUDE.md — MedTerminal Research Workspace

Read this first. It defines what this project is and the rules that govern every change.

## What this is

A **research workspace** used by a 2-person team (a project lead on desktop, a field
coordinator on a 375px phone) to run a six-phase qualitative research programme. The
programme decides whether a patient-side medical-tourism service (Kenya → India) is
viable enough to build. **This app is not that product** — it is the tool used to decide
whether to build it.

Read `docs/project-overview.md` for research intent and `docs/features.md` for screen
detail. `sql/schema.sql` and `worker.js` define the real data model.

## Architecture in one paragraph

`index.html` loads vanilla ES modules from `js/`. All configuration (data mode, current
phase, segments + targets, themes, team display names) lives in `js/config.js`. All data
access goes through `js/data.js` — one interface (`list/create/update/remove`), two
adapters: `local` (localStorage, seeded from `js/seed.js`, the default) and `api`
(Cloudflare Worker `worker.js` → Supabase, Bearer JWT from Supabase magic-link auth in
`js/auth.js`). Records are flat snake_case matching `sql/schema.sql`. `js/app.js` holds
state, the hash router, the phase-gated nav, and the shared component kit. One screen per
file in `js/screens/`. The AI assistant (`js/chat.js`) requires the Claude API and is
calmly disabled in local mode.

## Core rules — never violate

1. **No frameworks, no build step, no npm for the app.** Vanilla JS ES modules; Tailwind
   via CDN; one `css/theme.css`. Opens directly in a browser.
2. **Screens never call `fetch` or `localStorage` directly.** Everything goes through
   `js/data.js`.
3. **One canonical record shape**: flat snake_case (`interview_id`, `tagged_same_day`,
   `theme_tag`, `first_contact`). No `.fields` wrapper, ever.
4. **Config has one home.** Segments, themes, current phase, stall threshold, and team
   names come from `js/config.js`. Never redefine them in a screen. Never hardcode a
   person's name — use `getTeam()/interviewerOptions()/ownerOptions()`.
5. **Never render user-supplied text via `innerHTML`.** Use the `h()` helper /
   `textContent`. `innerHTML` is allowed only for clearing (`= ''`).
6. **Respect the same-day-tag rule.** The red warnings for untagged interviews are the
   app's most important data-quality mechanism. Never weaken them.
7. **Keep the aesthetic**: warm/editorial, sage + clay palette, Fraunces for headings and
   quotes, Inter for UI. Semantic colours: sage=done, honey=attention, rose=breach,
   info-blue=informational, plum=theme tags. Use the existing component classes
   (`.card`, `.chip`, `.banner`, `.quote-block`, `.bar-wrap`, `.btn`) before inventing new ones.
8. **Mobile-first.** Every screen must be fully usable at 375px. Test both 375px and
   1280px before committing.
9. **Every screen answers one question**, shown as its subheader (the fourth argument to
   `registerRoute`). List screens lead with the exception, not the totals.
10. **No API keys in the frontend.** The Worker (or Supabase Edge Function) holds all
    secrets in `api` mode.
